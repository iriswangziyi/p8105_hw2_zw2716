## Problem 1

First, define a path to the dataset.

``` r
path_to_data = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-1.xlsx"
```

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
    read_xlsx(
        path = path_to_data,
        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
        range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
        sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    )
```

Read precipitation data\! For 2018 and 2017.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-1.xlsx",
        sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
    relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-1.xlsx",
        sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
    relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation dataframes. In the following code
chunk, I create a “helper” tibble that contains pairs of numeric and
character ways of representing month, and then merge that (using month
number as a key) with the precipitation dataset. This technique is one I
use often when I need to recode a moderate or large number of values for
a variable.

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
        month = 1:12,
        month_name = month.name
    )

precip_df = 
    bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

precip_df =
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 416 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. In
this dataset:

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

First, define a path to Problem 2 dataset.

``` r
path_to_P2_data = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv"
```

Read the NYC Transit dataset, only retain line, station name, station
latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and
ADA compliance from the dataset.

``` r
nyc_subway_df = read_csv(path_to_P2_data) %>% 
    select(c("Line", "Station Name", "Station Latitude", "Station Longitude", 
             "Route1", "Route2", "Route3", "Route4", "Route5", "Route6", 
             "Route7", "Route8", "Route9", "Route10", "Route11", 
             "Entrance Type", "Entry", "Vending", "ADA")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = T, "NO" = F),
           vending = recode(vending, "YES" = T, "NO" = F),
           across(route1:route11,as.character))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

The variables in the NYC Transit dataset, called **nyc\_subway\_df**
are: line, station name, station latitude, station longitude, routes
served (1-11), entrance type, entry, vending, and ADA (compliance).  
For my data cleaning step, I have changed all the variables name to be
more readable and easy to work with (all lowercased, use "\_" instead of
" “). I also convert the entry and vending variables from character to a
logical variable, and convert all routes to be character. The dimension
of resulting dataset **nyc\_subway\_df** is 1868 x 19.  
The dataset is not very tidy to me. It will be better to have
a”route\_number" column along with a “route\_name” column instead of
route 1 to route 11.

In this dataset:  
\* There are 465 distinct stations.  
\* If considering distinct stations, then 84 stations are ADA compliant.
Otherwise, 468 stations are ADA compliant.  
\* The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance is 0.3770492.

nrow(distinct(filter(nyc\_subway\_df,vending==T), station\_name,line))

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables, then only keep the A train subdata.

``` r
reformated_nyc_subway_df = pivot_longer(nyc_subway_df, 
                                        route1:route11,
                                        names_to = "route_name",
                                        values_to = "route_number") %>% 
    filter(route_number == "A")
```

  - There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train.
  - 17 of the stations that serve the A train is ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv.

``` r
# month_df = tibble(month = 1:12,month_name = month.name)

pols = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
    separate(col = mon, 
             into = c("year", "month", "day"), 
             sep = "-") %>% 
    mutate(month = as.integer(month),
           month = month.name[month],
           president = prez_gop,
           president = recode(president, "1" = "gop", "0" = "dem")) %>% 
    select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop,-day) %>% 
    arrange(year,month)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

    ## Warning: Problem with `mutate()` input `president`.
    ## ℹ Unreplaced values treated as NA as .x is not compatible. Please specify replacements exhaustively or supply .default
    ## ℹ Input `president` is `recode(president, `1` = "gop", `0` = "dem")`.

    ## Warning: Unreplaced values treated as NA as .x is not compatible. Please specify
    ## replacements exhaustively or supply .default

Second, clean the data in snp.csv.

``` r
snp = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
    separate(col = date, 
             into = c("month", "day","year"), 
             sep = "/") %>% 
    mutate(month = as.integer(month),
           month = month.name[month]) %>% 
    select(-day) %>% 
    relocate("year", "month") %>% 
    arrange(year,month)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets.

``` r
month_abb = 
    tibble(
        month = month.abb,
        month_int = 1:12
    )

unemployment = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
    pivot_longer(Jan:Dec,
                 names_to = "month",
                 values_to = "%unemployment") %>% 
    left_join(month_abb, by = "month") %>% 
    mutate(month_int = month.name[month_int],
           Year = as.character(Year)) %>% 
    select(-month) %>% 
    rename(month = month_int,
           year = Year) %>% 
    relocate(year, month) %>% 
    arrange(year,month)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
result = left_join(left_join(pols,snp),unemployment)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")
    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")
